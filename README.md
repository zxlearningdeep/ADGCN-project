**Abstract:**  
---
Detecting abnormal users in social networks is crucial for protecting
user privacy and preventing criminal activities. However, existing graph learn-
ing methods have limitations. Unsupervised methods focus on topological
anomalies and may overlook user characteristics, while supervised methods re-
quire costly data annotations. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly
supervised framework called Anomaly Detection Graph Convolutional Network
(ADGCN). Our model includes three modules: information-preserving com-
pression of user features, collaborative mining of global and local graph infor-
mation, and multi-view weakly supervised classification. We demonstrate that
ADGCN generates high-quality user representations using minimal labeled data
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on two real-world social network da-
tasets. Ablation experiments and performance analyses show the feasibility and
effectiveness of our approach in practical scenarios.
